# Incident-series
Supplementary material to the research thesis "The forensic statistical analysis of incident series" by Patricia de Bruin.

In the folder ANOVA, one can find the Analysis of Variance of the simulation study done in Appendix B. 
In addition, one can find the corresponding simulated data and parameters estimates of rho and mu using the three estimation methods described in Chapter 11.

In the folder Arson, one can find the Python codes how to obtain Figures C.1 and C.3 that are referred to in Chapters 7 and 10. 

In the folder Gibbs sampler, one can find the R code of the implemented the Gibbs sampler used in Chapter 11.
Here, the Gibbs sampler programmed in Python is added as well.

In the folder NUTS, one can find the implemented No-U-Turn sampler programmed in Python with help of the package PyMC3.
This was also applied in Chapter 11.

Finally, in the folder Simulated data one can find the Excel and Rdata files of the simulated data that is used for the application of the three estimation methods described in Chapter 11.
